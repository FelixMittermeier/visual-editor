# Cursor (WIP)
The cursor is the blinking UI element that indicates the position where new characters will be inserted. 

## Floating Cursor
By using long tap on mobioles users can reposition the pointer at desired location without having to use single tap. This increases precision and confidence when selecting a new location to input text.
